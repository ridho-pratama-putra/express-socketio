EXPRESS & SOCKETIO
act as backend for realtime chat
- 
- Axios is a commonly used package to easily make requests to APIs.
- Cors allows our client to make requests to other origins – necessary for socket.io to work properly. See What is CORS? if you haven't heard of CORS before.
- Express is a NodeJS framework that allows us to write our backend more easily with less code.
- Socket.io is a library that allows the client and server to communicate in realtime – which isn't possible with standard HTTP requests.
- Dotenv is a module that allows us to store private keys and passwords safely, and load them into our code when needed.
